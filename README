Abstract:
The IKNetworkActivityManager class simplifies work with UIApplication network activity indicator. It turns your networkActivityIndicatorVisible = YES/NO code to add/removeNetworkUser:, so you don't need to remember about objects that can use network anymore.
See Demo App to get the idea.

Install:
Add content of the src/IKNetworkActivityManager folder to your project.
