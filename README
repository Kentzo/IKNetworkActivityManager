Abstract:
The IKNetworkActivityManager class simplifies work with UIApplication network activity indicator. It turns your networkActivityIndicatorVisible = YES/NO code to add/removeNetworkUser:, so you don't need to remember about objects that can use network anymore.
See Demo App to get the idea.
I used http://github.com/Kentzo/IKConnectionDelegate code in the demo app.

Install:
Add content of the src/IKNetworkActivityManager folder to your project.
