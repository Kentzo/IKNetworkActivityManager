Abstract:
The IKNetworkActivityManager class simplifies work with UIApplication network activity indicator. It turns your networkActivityIndicatorVisible = YES/NO code to add/removeNetworkUser:, so you don't need to remember objects that can use network anymore.
See Demo App to get the idea (Look at the Downloads section).
